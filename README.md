## DL model optimization for Lightweight Gesture Recognition

The goal of this project is to create a machine-learning algorithm that can categorize
photos of various hand movements for use in gesture navigation, including fists, palms,
and thumbs. The method used is Convolutional Neural Networks based on TensorFlow
and Keras, along with Deep Learning. The model was trained and tested using the
Hand Gesture Recognition Database on Kaggle, which contains 20,000 photos of 10
hand motions made by 10 people (5 men and 5 women).

Based on the high accuracy achieved (>95%), we can conclude that our deep learning
model is successful in accurately classifying different hand gesture images. The model's
performance is influenced by several aspects of the problem. Firstly, the hand gestures
presented in the dataset are reasonably distinct, meaning that there is enough variation
in the images to train the model to distinguish between them. Additionally, the images
are clear and without any background noise, making it easier for the model to identify
the hand gestures accurately.
Moreover, the quantity of images available for training and validation is sufficient, which
helps to make the model more robust and able to generalize well to new images.
Overall, the success of the model demonstrates the effectiveness of using deep
learning techniques for image classification tasks
